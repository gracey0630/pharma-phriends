# Pharma Phriends: Launch Analog and Input Tool

Team project. Helps a pharma forecaster choose and defend two launch-forecast inputs: the **ceiling** (peak patients, M) and the **trajectory** (uptake shape, Bass p/q from analog launches).

## Read first
1. [docs/user_journey.md](docs/user_journey.md): what the tool does, step by step (draft; changes via PR)
2. [docs/data_sources.md](docs/data_sources.md): what we pull, source rules, freshness checks
3. [docs/data_model.md](docs/data_model.md): tables, dependencies, workstreams, build status
4. [docs/decisions.md](docs/decisions.md): decision log and open questions

**The docs are the spec.** Build code to match them. If the design needs to change, change the doc in the same PR.

## Fixed scope
- US only; novel NDA/BLA brands (NME or new biologic), first indication, no generic entry in the first 3 years
- Pharmacy-dispensed, self-administered (oral or self-injected); no clinic-administered drugs
- Unit = dispensed prescriptions (TRx); analog curves are Medicaid (SDUD), Medicare Part D for cross-checks only
- Analog pool: launches from 2010 onward
- Out of scope for now: fills conversion, access scenarios, Monte Carlo

## Conventions
- Key: `analog_id` = `brand_key` + `route_group` (e.g. `skyrizi_sc`). One analog = brand × route group.
- Time series in long format: `analog_id, source, payer, period, metric, value, pulled_at`
- Never mix Medicaid and Medicare in one curve
- Suppressed SDUD values stay blank, never 0
- Indication, dosing and class come from the **original** approval label (Drugs@FDA ORIG), never DailyMed (current label)
- Agent-extracted values are saved with quote + source link and need human approval before use
- Folders: `data/raw/<source>/` downloads, unchanged, plus a manifest (gitignored); `data/reference/` manual / approved tables; `data/processed/` tables built by code
- Secrets in `.env` (gitignored); see `.env.example`

## Workflow
- Branch per task: `<workstream>/<topic>` (e.g. `b/sdud-ndc-map`); merge to `main` via PR
- A PR that adds or changes a table updates its row in the data_model.md build status
- A PR that settles an open question adds a row to the decisions.md log and removes the question
